3. Sequential model: A linear stack of layers in TensorFlow and Keras, where each layer has its inputs and outputs, facilitating the definition of feed-forward neural network architectures.

4. Dense layers: Fully connected layers in a neural network, where each neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer, allowing for complex learning capabilities.

5. Model compilation: The process of configuring the model for training, defining the optimization algorithm, loss function, and evaluation metrics before the training process.

6. Model summary: A compact and informative representation of the model architecture, displaying the layers, output shapes, and the number of parameters in each layer.

7. Standardization: The process of transforming data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, ensuring that features are on a similar scale, which is crucial for the convergence and performance of many machine learning algorithms.

8. Train-test split: The division of the dataset into a training set and a testing set, allowing the model to be trained on one set and evaluated on an unseen set to assess its performance.

9. Model training: The process of iteratively optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the defined loss function using the training data, enabling the model to learn patterns from the data.

10. Optimizers (Adam, SGD): Algorithms used to update the model's parameters during the training process, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), to minimize the loss function.

11. Hyperparameter tuning: The process of optimizing the hyperparameters of a model, leading to improved model performance and generalization on unseen data.

12. Evaluation metrics: Statistical measures used to assess the performance of a model, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC score, and confusion matrix.

13. Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances, providing a general understanding of the model's performance.

14. Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations, measuring the model's exactness.

15. Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the actual positives, measuring the model's completeness.

16. F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between precision and recall.

17. ROC-AUC score: The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, representing the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

19. Precision-Recall Curve: A graphical representation of the trade-off between precision and recall for different thresholds, aiding in model evaluation.

20. One-hot encoding: A process of converting categorical data into a numerical format, creating binary variables for each category, used for machine learning algorithms.

21. DateTime handling: Manipulation and extraction of date and time information from datetime objects, facilitating time-based analysis and feature engineering.

22. Feature engineering: The process of creating new features from the existing ones to improve the model's performance, including transformation, combination, and selection of features.

23. Categorical feature transformation: Converting categorical features into a format suitable for model training and prediction, such as one-hot encoding.

24. Dropout regularization: A technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during each update cycle.

25. Loss function: A function that quantifies the difference between the predicted values and the actual values, guiding the optimization process during model training.

26. Metrics evaluation: The process of assessing the model's performance using various statistical measures to understand its strengths and weaknesses.
